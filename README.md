# Low-level programming & Algorithm

## Introduction
A low-level programming language is considered to be a language whose instructions exercise direct control over the hardware and are conditioned by the physical structure of the computers that support it. The denomination "low" can lead to this not being as powerful as a language of "high level", however this in reality indicates low or no abstraction of the architecture of the set of instructions of a computer, close to the instructions of the processor, hence they are considered close to the hardware.

## 1. About
Holberton School's curriculum is geared towards creating a full-stack software engineer. Part of that curriculum addresses low-level programming, within which topics such as:

* Variables, variable types, loops and nested loops.
* Compilation and its stages.
* Code Style
* Prototype functions and functions.
* Conditional.
* Pointers.
* Data structures.
* Matrices.
* Bit manipulation.
* Data structures.
* Algorithms.
* Among other things.

The goal is to learn how a programming language and unix systems work.

## Requeriments

* Editors: vi, vim, emacs
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with 4.8.4
